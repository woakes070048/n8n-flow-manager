# n8n-flow-manager 🚀

**n8n-flow-manager** is a robust, production-ready Python SDK and CLI for the [n8n automation platform](https://n8n.io/). Unlike simple HTTP wrappers, this package is designed for **DevOps workflows**, providing type-safe models, async operations, workflow templating, and CI/CD integration capabilities.

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities

- **⚡ Async-First Design**: Built on `httpx` for high-performance async operations
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Complete Pydantic models for workflows, executions, and credentials
- **🔄 Smart Polling**: Execute workflows and wait for completion with intelligent status checking
- **📝 Jinja2 Templating**: Inject environment-specific variables into workflow definitions
- **🤖 Powerful CLI**: Terminal commands for backup, deploy, sync, and manage workflows
- **🔐 Secure**: API key authentication with proper error handling and retries
- **📦 Zero Config**: Works with environment variables or explicit configuration

### What Makes It Different?

| Feature | n8n-flow-manager | Generic HTTP Clients |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Type Validation | ✅ Pydantic models | ❌ Raw dicts |
| Async Support | ✅ Native asyncio | ⚠️ Sync only |
| Smart Execution | ✅ run_and_wait() | ❌ Manual polling |
| Templating | ✅ Jinja2 built-in | ❌ Not included |
| CLI Tools | ✅ Full featured | ❌ None |
| Error Handling | ✅ Custom exceptions | ⚠️ Generic errors |

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Poetry (recommended) or pip

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-flow-manager.git
cd n8n-flow-manager

# Install with Poetry (recommended)
poetry install --with dev
```

### Install CLI Globally (Use `n8n-py` anywhere)

```bash
# Create wrapper script
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cat > ~/.local/bin/n8n-py << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/n8n-flow-manager
poetry run n8n-py "$@"
EOF
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/n8n-py

# Add to PATH (if not already)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Now use directly anywhere:
n8n-py health
n8n-py list-workflows
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
N8N_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
N8N_BASE_URL=https://n8n.example.com
```

Or export as environment variables:

```bash
export N8N_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export N8N_BASE_URL="https://n8n.example.com"
```

#### Getting Your API Key

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Settings** → **API**
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy and save it securely

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### 1. Python SDK Usage

#### Basic Client Usage

```python
import asyncio
from n8n_manager import N8NClient

async def main():
    # Initialize client (reads from environment)
    async with N8NClient() as client:

        # List all active workflows
        workflows = await client.workflows.list(active=True)
        for wf in workflows:
            print(f"Workflow: {wf.name} (ID: {wf.id})")

        # Get specific workflow
        workflow = await client.workflows.get("workflow_id")
        print(f"Nodes: {len(workflow.nodes)}")

        # Execute workflow and wait for result
        execution = await client.executions.run_and_wait(
            workflow_id="workflow_id",
            timeout=60
        )
        print(f"Status: {execution.status}")
        print(f"Success: {execution.is_successful}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Creating Workflows Programmatically

```python
from n8n_manager import N8NClient
from n8n_manager.models.workflow import Workflow, Node

async def create_simple_workflow():
    async with N8NClient() as client:
        workflow = Workflow(
            name="Python-Created Workflow",
            active=False,
            nodes=[
                Node(
                    name="Start",
                    type="n8n-nodes-base.start",
                    position=[250, 300],
                    parameters={}
                ),
                Node(
                    name="Set Data",
                    type="n8n-nodes-base.set",
                    position=[450, 300],
                    parameters={
                        "values": {
                            "string": [
                                {"name": "message", "value": "Hello from Python!"}
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                )
            ],
            connections={
                "Start": {
                    "main": [[{"node": "Set Data", "type": "main", "index": 0}]]
                }
            }
        )

        created = await client.workflows.create(workflow)
        print(f"Created workflow: {created.id}")
```

#### Using Templates

```python
from n8n_manager.utils.templating import load_workflow_from_file

# Load workflow with template variables
workflow = load_workflow_from_file(
    "templates/data_sync.json",
    variables={
        "environment": "production",
        "api_endpoint": "https://api.example.com",
        "timeout": 30
    }
)

async with N8NClient() as client:
    deployed = await client.workflows.create(workflow)
    print(f"Deployed: {deployed.name}")
```

### 2. CLI Usage

The CLI provides powerful commands for workflow management.
